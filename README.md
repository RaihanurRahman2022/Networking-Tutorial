## Introduction to Computer Networks

A computer network enables devices to communicate, share resources, and exchange data. Understanding networks is critical for backend engineers working on distributed systems, APIs, or cloud infrastructure.

### Key Concepts
- **Definition**: A system of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers) that communicate using protocols.
- **Purpose**: Facilitate data sharing, resource access (e.g., files, printers), and application connectivity.
- **Core Components**:
  - **Devices/Nodes**: Endpoints like computers, servers, or IoT devices.
  - **Networking Hardware**:
    - **Routers**: Direct traffic between networks using IP addresses.
    - **Switches**: Connect devices within a network, using MAC addresses.
    - **Access Points**: Enable Wi-Fi connectivity.
  - **Transmission Media**: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals.
- **Protocols**:
  - **TCP/IP**: Ensures reliable data transfer and addressing.
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: Powers web communication.
  - **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **Network Models**:
  - **OSI Model**: 7 layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).
  - **TCP/IP Model**: 4 layers (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).
- **Interview Questions**:
  - What’s the difference between TCP and UDP?
  - Explain the OSI model and its layers.
  - How does DNS resolution work?

### Example
A backend engineer builds an API server that communicates over HTTPS. The server’s IP address is resolved via DNS, and TCP ensures reliable data delivery to clients.

## Types of Networks and Interconnected Networks

Networks vary by scale and purpose. Knowing their types and how they interconnect is essential for designing scalable systems.

### Local Area Network (LAN)
- **Definition**: A network within a small geographical area (e.g., office, home).
- **Characteristics**: High-speed, low-latency, privately managed.
- **Use Case**: Office computers connected via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
- **Interview Question**: How would you secure a LAN from unauthorized access?

### Wide Area Network (WAN)
- **Definition**: A network spanning large areas (e.g., cities, countries).
- **Characteristics**: Slower than LANs, often managed by ISPs.
- **Use Case**: The internet, connecting global data centers.
- **Interview Question**: What challenges arise when scaling a WAN?

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- **Definition**: A network covering a city or campus.
- **Characteristics**: Connects multiple LANs within a metropolitan area.
- **Use Case**: University campus network linking departments.
- **Interview Question**: When would a MAN be preferred over a WAN?

### Personal Area Network (PAN)
- **Definition**: A network for personal devices within a short range (e.g., 10 meters).
- **Characteristics**: Uses Bluetooth, USB, or infrared.
- **Use Case**: Syncing a smartphone with a laptop.
- **Interview Question**: What are the security risks of a PAN?

### Interconnected Networks
- **Definition**: Linking multiple networks to form a larger system (e.g., the internet).
- **Key Devices**:
  - **Bridges**: Connect LANs at the data link layer.
  - **Routers**: Route data across networks using IP.
  - **Gateways**: Translate between different protocols.
- **Protocols**:
  - **BGP**: Manages routing across autonomous systems.
  - **MPLS**: Optimizes data paths in large networks.
- **Interview Question**: How does BGP ensure efficient routing on the internet?

### Example
A company’s LAN in one city connects to a cloud provider’s data center (WAN) via routers. BGP ensures optimal data paths, while gateways handle protocol translations for compatibility.

## Network and Logical Topologies

Topologies define how devices are arranged and how data flows in a network, impacting performance and reliability.

### Physical Topologies
Physical topologies describe the physical connections between devices.

#### Bus Topology
- **Description**: All devices connect to a single cable.
- **Pros**: Simple, cost-effective.
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, scalability issues.
- **Use Case**: Small, temporary networks.

#### Star Topology
- **Description**: Devices connect to a central hub/switch.
- **Pros**: Easy to manage, scalable, isolated failures.
- **Cons**: Hub/switch is a single point of failure.
- **Use Case**: Most modern office LANs.

#### Ring Topology
- **Description**: Devices form a closed loop, each connected to the next.
- **Pros**: Equal access, predictable data flow.
- **Cons**: One device failure can disrupt the network.
- **Use Case**: Legacy networks like Token Ring.

#### Mesh Topology
- **Description**: Devices are interconnected with multiple paths.
- **Pros**: Highly reliable, no single point of failure.
- **Cons**: Expensive, complex setup.
- **Use Case**: Critical infrastructure like data centers.

### Logical Topologies
- **Definition**: How data flows, regardless of physical layout.
- **Examples**:
  - A physical star topology may use a logical bus for broadcasting.
  - A physical mesh may use logical point-to-point connections.
- **Key Considerations**: Logical topologies affect data routing efficiency and network performance.
- **Interview Questions**:
  - How does a logical topology differ from a physical one?
  - Why might a star topology use a logical bus?

### Example
A data center uses a mesh topology for redundancy but logically routes data point-to-point to optimize performance for specific server-to-server communication.
